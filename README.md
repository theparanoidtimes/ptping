# ptping

Version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT

**ptping** is a Java application designed as a "wrapper around the *ping* command".
This is not a Java ICMP implementation. Application executes *ping* command and
wraps the response in an object. This object can later be queried for any data
that is normally presented as a *ping* output.

## Usage

Java 8 or above is required and it can be run on Windows and Unix systems.

Commands are executed by `PingCommandRunner` class and `PingResult` is the result
object.

To execute a ping command:

```java
PingResult pingResult = PingCommandRunner.executePing("google.com");

System.out.println(pingResult.getCompleteOutput());

// Pinging google.com [172.217.16.110] with 32 bytes of data:
// Reply from 172.217.16.110: bytes=32 time=14ms TTL=57
// Reply from 172.217.16.110: bytes=32 time=14ms TTL=57
// Reply from 172.217.16.110: bytes=32 time=24ms TTL=57
// Reply from 172.217.16.110: bytes=32 time=11ms TTL=57
// Reply from 172.217.16.110: bytes=32 time=13ms TTL=57
// Ping statistics for 172.217.16.110:
// Packets: Sent = 5, Received = 5, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
// Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
// Minimum = 11ms, Maximum = 24ms, Average = 15ms
```

The resulted object can be queried for data later:

```java
System.out.println(pingResult.isSuccessful());
// true

System.out.println(pingResult.getPingTarget());
// google.com

System.out.println(pingResult.getTargetIp());
// 172.217.16.110
```

Each ping response line can be queried also:

```java
pingResult.getAttemptLines().forEach(attemptLine ->
                System.out.println(attemptLine.getTime()));
// 14.0
// 14.0
// 24.0
// ...
```

Also you can query multiple targets at the same time:

```java
List<PingResult> pingResults = PingCommandRunner.executePingToTargets("yahoo.com", "hotmail.com");
// query each file as needed...
```
