# ptping

Version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT

**ptping** is a Java application designed as a "wrapper around the *ping* command".
This is not a Java ICMP implementation. Application executes *ping* command and
wraps the response in an object. This object can later be queried for any data
that is normally presented as a *ping* output.

Java 1.8 is required and it can be run on Windows and Unix systems.

## Usage

Commands are executed by `PingCommandRunner` class and `PingResult` is the result
object.

To execute a ping command:

```java
PingResult pingResult = PingCommandRunner.executePing("google.com");

System.out.println(pingResult.getCompleteOutput());

// Pinging google.com [172.217.18.78] with 32 bytes of
// Reply from 172.217.18.78: bytes=32 time=19ms TTL=57
// ...
```

The resulted object can be queried for data later:

```java
System.out.println(pingResult.isSuccessful());
// true

System.out.println(pingResult.getPingTarget());
// google.com

System.out.println(pingResult.getTargetIp());
// 172.217.18.78
```

Each ping response line can be queried also:

```java
pingResult.getAttemptLines().forEach(attemptLine ->
                System.out.println(attemptLine.getTTL()));
// 57
// 57
// ...
```
